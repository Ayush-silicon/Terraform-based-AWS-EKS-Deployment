# Terraform-based AWS EKS Deployment 

Problem: Organizations struggle with secure, scalable, and observable multi-environment Kubernetes deployments with compliance, cost tracking, and resiliency.

Solution: Build a “Production-Grade EKS Platform-as-Code” that:

Auto-provisions environments (dev/staging/prod)

Supports GitOps CD workflows

Offers dashboards for cost, performance, and health

Integrates secrets, backups, and security scanning
