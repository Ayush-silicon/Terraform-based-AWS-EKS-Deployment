# Terraform-based-AWS-EKS-Deployment
Problem: Organizations struggle with secure, scalable, and observable multi-environment Kubernetes deployments with compliance, cost tracking, and resiliency.

Solution: Build a “Production-Grade EKS Platform-as-Code” that:

1-Auto-provisions environments (dev/staging/prod)
2-Supports GitOps CD workflows
3-Offers dashboards for cost, performance, and health
4-Integrates secrets, backups, and security scanning
