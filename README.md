# Terraform-based-AWS-EKS-Deployment
Problem: Organizations struggle with secure, scalable, and observable multi-environment Kubernetes deployments with compliance, cost tracking, and resiliency.

Solution: Build a ‚ÄúProduction-Grade EKS Platform-as-Code‚Äù that:

1-Auto-provision environments (dev/staging/prod)

2-Supports GitOps CD workflows

3-Offers dashboards for cost, performance, and health

4-Integrates secrets, backups, and security scanning

üîß Advanced Features to Integrate
1. GitOps with ArgoCD
Auto-sync Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts from a Git repo.

Real-time deployment status and rollback.

Separate apps by namespace/project.

2. Service Mesh Integration
Use Istio or Linkerd for secure service-to-service communication, telemetry, retries, and circuit breaking.

3. Cost Visibility with Kubecost
Deploy Kubecost to track:

Cost per namespace/pod/service

Wasted spend on overprovisioned nodes

Alerts on budget overruns

4. Prometheus + Grafana Monitoring Stack
Export EKS cluster, node, and pod metrics.

Create custom Grafana dashboards for:

Cluster Health (CPU/memory/disk usage)

App metrics (request rate, latency, error rate)

Infrastructure (EC2 usage, EBS IOPS, network traffic)

5. Open Policy Agent (OPA) with Gatekeeper
Enforce policies like:

"No container runs as root"

"Require resource limits"

"Disallow public services"

6. Sealed Secrets (Bitnami) or SOPS
Encrypt Kubernetes secrets in Git safely.

Ensure DevSecOps pipelines support secret injection securely.

7. Disaster Recovery & Backups
Velero for scheduled EBS volume snapshots, namespace backups, and cluster migration.

Integrate into Terraform modules for backup policy deployment.

8. Event-Driven Auto-Scaling
KEDA for fine-grained autoscaling based on metrics (e.g., SQS messages, Prometheus queries).
